# ECS Deployment Using CI/CD with Terraform
This repository contains the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and CI/CD pipeline setup for deploying containerized applications to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) using Terraform. With this configuration.

The main goal of this project is to simplify the deployment of containerized applications on Amazon ECS. we use Terraform for defining and managing the infrastructure, and we set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the application deployment process. This allows you to focus on your application's code while ensuring reliable, repeatable, and scalable deployments.
